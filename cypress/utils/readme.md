# UTILS

## Usage

- This directory is dedicated for utility functions. 
- When creating `js` files, make a directory for each `Module` as a way to organize the files.

## File Format

`Module` > `test-file`.js

## Standard

Please use the general standard for Javascript development. ESLint will also help on writing the best standard for cypress tests.
